This year, over 15,000 participants joined walks in 42 cities, turning each event into a powerful, public statement about mental health destigmatization.</p><p>Participants walked alongside mental health professionals, survivors, and first responders—creating a visible, unified front against the silence that often surrounds suicide and mental health struggles.</p><p>"There is something profoundly cathartic about walking with thousands of people who understand," said volunteer coordinator James Patel. "The conversations that happen on these walks change minds and save lives."</p><p>Surveys conducted after the events showed that 87% of participants felt more comfortable discussing mental health with friends and family after attending. SPAN plans to expand the program to 60 cities next year.</p>`,
